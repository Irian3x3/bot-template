# Bot template
Ok, this is basically just the template I use for all my [discord.j](https://discord.js.org "The mighty discord.js")[s](https://npmjs.com/package/discord.js "The mighty discord.js") bots  
### This is free to use, you can use it by running the command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Irian3x3/bot-template.git
```

Also remember to make a commands folder and install discord.js:
```
npm i discord.js
```

### You need to install [node.js](https://nodejs.org "Here you can install node.js") and [Git](https://git-scm.com "Install Git"):
Git for: cloning this repository  
Node.js for: installing discord.js
