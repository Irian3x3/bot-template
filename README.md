# Bot template
Ok, this is basically just the template I use for all my [discord.j](https://discord.js.org "The mighty discord.js")[s](https://npmjs.com/package/discord.js "The mighty discord.js") bots  
### This is free to use, you can use it by running the command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Irian3x3/bot-template.git
```
